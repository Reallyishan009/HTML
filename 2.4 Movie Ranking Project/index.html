 <h1>Best Movies According To Ishan Tripathi</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>1. Spirited Away</h3>
 <p>This is my favourite anime movie of all time.</p>
 <h3>2. Goodwill Hunting</h3>
<p>This movie made by Matt Damon and Ben Afflick, (which own an oscar by the way) was their first directed movie when they were just 24. It touches all the aspects of one's life and how it should be lived</p>
<h3>3. Green Book</h3>
<p>Always makes me cry. It is about friendship, passion, anti-raceism and alot more.</p>
